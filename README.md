k-means-Clustering-Algorithm

Simple k-means clustering algorithm, kmeans, using the Euclidean distance for 2-dimensional numerical data.

Program executes as follows:
kmeans k input.txt, where input parameter k > 1 is an integer, specifying the number of clusters. 
input.txt is an input file containing many 2-dimensional data points
Program outputs a txt file called output.txt, in the following format:
In output.txt, 1 and 2 are cluster labels. Each data point is labeled using one of the labels from 1 to k.

**Please Note: code is written in Python 3**
